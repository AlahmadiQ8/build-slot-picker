This repository provides a basic scaffold for building a time slot picker.

This component must use Luxon and MUI for the date picker.

## Needs attention

* Unit tests
* Localization
* When you click on a time slot, it only focuses on the element. It should remain selected when you lose focus
* component does not have callbacks to pass in selected date/time
* big mess passing around props here and there
* poor styling
* no textfield input for date. didn't have enough time to work on that 
* poorly named components
